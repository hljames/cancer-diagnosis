## CS209B Final Project

>Group $17$: David Melancon, Estefania Lahera, Hailey James, Nathan Einstein

## Project Statement

While studies show computer vision can detect cancer with high accuracy, there is a strong need to increase interpretability of the complex convolutional neural networks (CNN) used for detection. In this project, we focus on the Curated Breast Imaging Subset of the Digital Database for Screening Mammography (CBIS-DDSM). Classification models are trained on the dataset using transfer learning on the ResNet50 and VGG16 architectures . Once trained, the models are used to investigate the efficiency of different methods of interpretation and explainability including saliency maps, saliency maps through perturbations as well as Shapley and LIME values.
